### Deployment Triggers

| Environment | Trigger | Version Format | Security Level |
|-------------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **Development** | Branches (feature/*, develop) | `dev-{sha}-{timestamp}` | Basic |
| **Staging** | Branches (main, staging) | `staging-{sha}-{timestamp}` | Standard |
| **Pre-Production** | Tags (v1.2.3-rc.1, v1.2.3-pre.1) | `v1.2.3-rc.1` | Enhanced |
| **Production** | Tags (v1.2.3) | `v1.2.3` | Maximum |

## üè≠ Production Deployment Strategy

### Enterprise-Grade Validations

Production deployments undergo comprehensive validation:

#### 1. üîê Security Validations

**Tag Signature Verification:**
- Production tags must be GPG-signed
- Verifies authenticity and integrity
- Configurable via `ALLOW_UNSIGNED_PROD_TAGS`

**Security Scan Requirements:**
- Full SAST, SCA, and KICS scans required
- Vulnerability thresholds enforced
- Can be overridden with `SKIP_PROD_SECURITY_SCANS`

#### 2. üìÖ Deployment Time Windows

**Business Hours Enforcement:**
- Default: Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 5 PM
- Configurable via `PROD_DEPLOYMENT_HOURS` and `PROD_DEPLOYMENT_DAYS`
- Emergency override: `EMERGENCY_DEPLOYMENT=true`

**Change Freeze Periods:**
- Automatic detection of holiday periods
- Integration with change management systems
- Configurable blackout windows

#### 3. üìã Approval Workflows

**Risk-Based Approvals:**
- Major releases (v2.0.0): Mandatory approval
- Minor releases (v1.2.0): Optional approval
- Patch releases (v1.1.1): Automated (configurable)

**Approval Requirements:**
- Set `REQUIRE_PROD_APPROVAL=true` for mandatory approvals
- Supports integration with external approval systems

#### 4. üìö Documentation Requirements

**Release Documentation:**
- `CHANGELOG.md` or `RELEASE_NOTES.md` required
- Configurable via `REQUIRE_RELEASE_DOCS`
- Automatic validation and parsing

### Production Deployment Process

```yaml
# 1. Tag Creation (Signed)
git tag -s v1.2.3 -m "Production release v1.2.3"
git push origin v1.2.3

# 2. Automatic Validation Pipeline
- Security scan execution
- Time window validation  
- Documentation verification
- Risk assessment

# 3. Deployment Execution
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Health check validation
- Monitoring activation
- Rollback readiness

# 4. Post-Deployment
- Smoke tests execution
- Performance monitoring
- Error rate tracking
- Success notification
```

## üéØ Pre-Production Strategy

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Production Issues

**Deployment Blocked - Outside Window:**
```bash
# Check current time and policy
echo "Current time: $(date)"
echo "Allowed hours: $PROD_DEPLOYMENT_HOURS"
echo "Allowed days: $PROD_DEPLOYMENT_DAYS"

# Emergency override
gh variable set EMERGENCY_DEPLOYMENT --body "true"
```

**Tag Signature Verification Failed:**
```bash
# Verify GPG configuration
gpg --list-secret-keys
git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_KEY_ID

# Re-sign tag
git tag -s v1.2.3 -f -m "Production release v1.2.3"
git push origin v1.2.3 --force
```

**Security Scan Failures:**
```bash
# Review scan results
gh run view --log

# Temporary override (not recommended)
gh variable set SKIP_PROD_SECURITY_SCANS --body "true"
```

### Emergency Procedures

**Critical Production Issue:**
```bash
# 1. Create hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-fix-v1.2.4

# 2. Apply fix and test
# ... make changes ...

# 3. Create emergency release
git tag -s v1.2.4 -m "Emergency hotfix: Critical production issue"

# 4. Enable emergency deployment
gh variable set EMERGENCY_DEPLOYMENT --body "true"

# 5. Push for immediate deployment
git push origin v1.2.4
```

## üìö Best Practices
