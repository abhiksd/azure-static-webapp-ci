### Configuration

Health checks can be configured per environment:

```json
{
  "healthChecks": {
    "timeout": 30000,
    "retryAttempts": 3,
    "retryDelay": 5000,
    "thresholds": {
      "responseTime": 2000,
      "availability": 0.95
    }
  }
}
```

## üìä Monitoring & Alerting

### Real-Time Monitoring

The monitoring system provides continuous oversight of your applications:

```bash
# Start monitoring
node scripts/monitoring.js

# With custom configuration
MONITOR_INTERVAL=30000 PROD_URL=https://myapp.com node scripts/monitoring.js
```

### Features

- **Automated Health Checks** - Continuous validation
- **Performance Tracking** - Response time and availability metrics
- **Error Rate Monitoring** - Automatic error detection and trending
- **Alert Management** - Configurable thresholds and notifications
- **Dashboard Generation** - Real-time HTML dashboards

### Alert Channels

#### Slack Integration
```bash
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK"
```

#### Microsoft Teams Integration
```bash
export TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL="https://your-org.webhook.office.com/YOUR/TEAMS/WEBHOOK"
```

### Alert Thresholds

| Metric | Default Threshold | Description |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| Response Time | 3000ms | Alert if average response time exceeds |
| Error Rate | 5% | Alert if error rate exceeds |

## üîÑ Rollback System

### Automated Rollback

The system can automatically rollback deployments that fail health checks:

```bash
# Enable auto-rollback in deployment
enable-rollback: 'true'
rollback-threshold: '20'  # Trigger rollback if 20% of health checks fail
```

### Manual Rollback

```bash
# Rollback to previous version
node scripts/rollback.js rollback production

# Rollback to specific version
node scripts/rollback.js rollback production v1.2.3

# Record a deployment
node scripts/rollback.js record production v1.2.4 https://myapp.com
```

### Rollback Process

1. **Pre-rollback Checks**
   - Validate target deployment availability
   - Check for ongoing operations
   - Verify rollback permissions

node scripts/health-check.js https://myapp.com production

# Common causes:
# - Slow response times (>3s)
# - Missing security headers
# - Application not fully loaded
# - Network connectivity issues
```

#### Monitoring Alerts
```bash
# Check monitoring status
cat monitoring-metrics.json

# Common causes:
# - High error rates
